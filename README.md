# Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) consisting of a simple game with UI written in JavaScript.

At the start of the project, I used the knowledge of how to declare variables, how to use functions, conditionals, and loops. In revisiting of the project, I made an UI in HTML with responsive buttons, score and result text, using DOM manipulation methods and event listeners for clicks.
